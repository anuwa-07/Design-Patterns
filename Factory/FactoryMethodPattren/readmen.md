# The Dependency Inversion Principle
" Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes. "
    - It suggests that our high-level components should not depend on our low-level components; rather, they should both depend on abstractions.

    High Level Components
        - A class which it behavior define in other Low-Level components.
            as a exaple our PizzaStore is high-level component, Because it behaviors define in pizza it use to create.
